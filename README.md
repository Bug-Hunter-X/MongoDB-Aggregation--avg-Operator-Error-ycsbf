This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines, specifically concerning the use of the `$avg` operator. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect field path within the `$avg` operator.  This example highlights the importance of careful field path specification in MongoDB aggregation queries to avoid unexpected results or errors.
